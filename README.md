## About

The purpose of this project is to explore the predicability of atmospheric trace substance concentraions using meteorological variables.

This project/model are very much in the development stage. Results are preliminary.

The PASTEL model uses meteorological variables calculated at along backwards trajectories generated by the NOAA HYSPLIT model as inputs to make predictions about atmospheric trace substance concentrations
  using Sci-Kit Learn's Random Forest Regression algorithm.

## Getting Started

Download the main PASTEL.py file and the supporting .csv file. It might be necessary to change some of the code that grabs labels for plots and such as they are often tied to the directory path. 

Be sure to look at 'Prerequisites' section for necessary packages.

### Prerequisites

The provided 'environment.yml' file is all the packages currently required to run the main PASTEL.py file. 

To install the environment file run this line in an anaconda prompt window:

  conda env create -f environment.yml

### Installation

Downloading the main PASTEL.py file is the best way to go for now! There should be plans to transition this code to a more module style of coding to put on a pypi distribution however, many changes are needed before distribution.

## Usage

This project is in it early stages and has some significant challenges yet, but please feel free to explore what you can with the model. It has several features, with many more to be added in the coming monthes.

## Features

Predtions of 100+ VOCs along ATom 24 hour backwards trajectories derived from ERA5 Meteorology.

.csv file containing joined trajectory and ATom data!

## Contributing

Main contributions include making the model compatibe with all VOCs in the spreadsheet and adapting code so that this process is more streamlined. 

Additionally there exists a package for Utility Based Regression in R here: https://github.com/paobranco/UBL I believe that implementing this for python and as a part of this project would be benifical for more accurate predictions while using the SMOGN algorithm.
